       "\"At first when I got it, I assumed everything was fine, but i quickly noticed that there were a couple things off about the controller. It might have been my paranoia, but I dont think these controllers are authentic. My right analog stick has stopped working within 4 months of me buying the controller. I had my original controller for years before it stopped working, and this one didn't even last half a year. I don't understand how that is possible. I bought one from Best Buy on Black Friday and compared, and there are minute details that are off with the touch pad and the directional pad. Additionally, the serial number label on the back of the controller is different than the other controllers I have (two I bought from Best Buy a couple days ago). I recommend buying from the store...these are not the wave!\""
